# Analyzing Business Travel Program Performance

Company A is an insurance company which sends approximately 100 employees on business travel per month. When booking business travel, Company A employees should shop and make their hotel bookings on the company’s official booking tool, which exclusively offer rates that the Business Travel Program group has negotiated with hotel suppliers Hilton and Marriott. However, due to price competitiveness and/or availability, Company A employees sometimes make bookings outside of the official booking tool.

Company A’s Business Travel Program managers would like reporting on whether or not the current rate the company is spending on business travel is competitive compared to the market rate for comparable hotel stays. To reduce the current spend on business travel for hotel stays, Business Travel Program managers can either 

1. increase the percentage of employees using the approved booking tool, or
2. Renegotiate existing contracts with Hilton and/or Marriott to maintain a prices for Company A.

The following dashboard linked [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leia5972/viz/shared/NP63MFKWW) answers those reporting needs.
